# ETLpipeline
Made this while learning what a ETL pipeline is through python.

What is ETL?
ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load. It is conceptual framework followed when the goal is to extract data from a source and load it into a particular dataware house after needed transformation.


Step by step:
1. Extract: Selecting data from single or multiple sources
2. Transform: Changing this data based on what is asked by the business. Generally involves two steps: cleansing, and manipulation    
3. Load: Loading the transformed data into the data warehouse.

My example:
Using a webscraper in python, extracting information about housing options in Amsterdam, and converting it into compact form using NLP libraries, and finally storing it an csv or sql database.
